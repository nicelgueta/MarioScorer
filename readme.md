Mario kart Tracker

This mario kart score tracker uses the True Skill library in order to rate players based on their relative skill compared to other players.
The mean (mu) score is the one that drives the mini league

This mini-app is designed to run in the cloud (like Heroku) and scores are persisted using mongo DB.
